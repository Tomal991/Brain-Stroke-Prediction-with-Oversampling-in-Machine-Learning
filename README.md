# Brain-Stroke-Prediction-with-Oversampling-in-Machine-Learning
To predict whether a patient will have stroke or not based on some given attributes, to analysis the attributes that are factors to brain stroke and visualize them by ploting, to predict brain stroke early stages so that people can take treatment as soon as possible. I have collected the dataset from Kaggle.com. The dataset has 5111 records/rows and 12 attributes. Attributes are-Id,age,gender,ever_married,work_type,residence_type,smoking_status,avg_glucose_level,BMI,hypertension[0,1],heart_disease[0,1] and stroke is the class/target attribute[0,1].To improve accuracy, data preprocessing is used to balance the data. To handle imbalance data I have used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) which is a oversampling technique where the synthetic samples are generated for the minority class to overcome the overfitting problem. Algorithm/Classifiers were Decision Tree (Random Forest),KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors),SVM,MLP and Regression. Random forest showed the highest accuracy before and after oversampling, SVM the least. I have used F1 score and accuracy to evaluate the performance of the model.
